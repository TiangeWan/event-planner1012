For this project, our idea is to create an event-planner website for users to organize the important dates. The interface of our website will show the full information of the calendar including dates, reminders, holidays, and so on. The entire website will be as concise as possible, and all information will be displayed clearly. Users can use this event-planner website to effectively obtain their schedule orderly and on time.
