Description: 
Project: Database
For this project, our idea is to create an event-planner website for users to organize the important dates. The interface of our website will show the full information of the calendar including dates, reminders, holidays, and so on. The entire website will be as concise as possible, and all information will be displayed clearly. Users can use this event-planner website to effectively obtain their schedule orderly and on time.

Functional requirement:
1. Store text information inserted by users
2. Images can be stored if needed
3. Users can edit and remove their information if they want   
4. Information can be displayed properly through a chart
5. Collect user's data for future use
6. Users can create different categories to manage their information
7. Users can receive reminder if there is an event
8. The time conflicts can be displayed if they exist
9.
